# 🚨 Critical Missing Features

1. Error Handling & Dead Letter Queue (Implemented)

- No failed job recovery mechanism
- No DLQ for permanently failed jobs
- Missing error propagation up the DAG

2. Job Cancellation & Pause/Resume (Implemented)

- Can't cancel running workflows
- No pause/resume functionality
- No timeout handling for long-running nodes

3. Data Passing Between Nodes (Implemented)

- ✅ Automatic parent output passing
- ✅ Single parent: child receives parent.data directly
- ✅ Multiple parents: child receives merged object { 'parent-id': data }
- ✅ Entry nodes receive initial workflow data
- ✅ Sequential execution ensures data availability

Implementation: Nodes are enqueued only after all parents complete. Parent outputs are automatically fetched from state store and passed as inputData.

4. Conditional Branching (Implemented)

- ✅ Support for "if/else" logic via `nextNodes`
- ✅ Can skip branches based on conditions
- ✅ Switch/router node types supported
- ✅ Skipped nodes propagate status to children
- ✅ Join nodes handle skipped parents correctly

5. Parallel Execution Limits (Implemented)

- ✅ Concurrency control per workflow via `maxConcurrency`
- ✅ Limit parallel branches (enforced by workflow concurrency)
- ✅ Rate limiting per node type via `NodeRegistry`


6. Webhook/Trigger Support (Implemented)

- ✅ Webhook triggers via `/api/webhooks/:path`
- ✅ Cron/schedule triggers (BullMQ repeatable jobs)
- ✅ Event-based workflow activation


7. Sub-workflows (Implemented)

- ✅ **Sub-workflow node type** - `sub-workflow` node type registered in `NodeRegistry`
- ✅ **Checkpoint & Resume Pattern** - Non-blocking execution (See `executeSubWorkflow` in `workflow-engine.ts`)
- ✅ **Completion Hooks** - Auto-resume parent on child completion (See `checkWorkflowCompletion` in `workflow-engine.ts`)
- ✅ **Depth Limiting** - Max 10 levels to prevent recursion (See `enqueueWorkflow` in `workflow-engine.ts`)
- ✅ **Data Mapping** - Input/Output mapping between parent and child (See `executeSubWorkflow` in `workflow-engine.ts`)
- ✅ **Error Propagation** - Child failures propagate to parent (See `executeSubWorkflow` in `workflow-engine.ts`)

Implementation:
- **Non-blocking**: Parent nodes save state and return `checkpoint: true` immediately, freeing workers.
- **Auto-resume**: `checkWorkflowCompletion` detects child finish and re-enqueues parent with `subWorkflowStep: 'complete'`.
- **Persistence**: Parent metadata stored in `ExecutionState.metadata` for reliable resumption.

8. Observability & Debugging (Implemented)

- ✅ **Node Execution Logging** - Detailed logs for every node execution step (See `ExecutionLog` in `types.ts`)
- ✅ **Execution Tracing** - Spans tracking start/end times and status for performance analysis (See `ExecutionTrace` in `types.ts`)
- ✅ **Replay Capabilities** - Ability to re-run past executions with linkage to original (See `replayWorkflow` in `workflow-engine.ts`)
- ✅ **Debugging Context** - Error propagation and metadata storage for detailed debugging
- ✅ **Verification** - Verified with `examples/observability.ts`

Implementation:
- **Data Model**: Added `ExecutionLog`, `ExecutionTrace`, and `ExecutionSpan` interfaces.
- **Storage**: Updated `IExecutionStateStore` and `InMemoryExecutionStore` to support logs and traces.
- **Instrumentation**: `WorkflowEngine` now automatically logs execution events and creates spans for node execution.
- **Replay**: `replayWorkflow` method allows re-triggering workflows while maintaining a reference to the original execution.
- **Persistence**: `initialData` is now stored in `ExecutionState` to ensure accurate replays.

9. State Management Issues

- In-memory store loses data on restart
- No transaction support
- Missing optimistic locking for concurrent updates

10. Security & Multi-tenancy

- No authentication/authorization
- Missing tenant isolation
- No secrets management for node configs
- No input validation/sanitization

11. Advanced Queue Features

- No job prioritization
- Missing delayed/scheduled jobs
- No job deduplication
- Missing bulk operations

12. Production Operations

- No health checks for workers
- Missing graceful degradation
- No circuit breaker pattern
- No metrics/prometheus integration
